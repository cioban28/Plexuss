<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>2.6 Payment</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you purchase any services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or subscription basis (&ldquo;Premium Services&rdquo;), you agree to Plexuss storing your payment information. You also agree to pay the applicable fees for the Premium Services as they become due plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. Failure to pay may result in the termination of your subscription. Depending on where you transact with us, the type of payment method used and where your payment method was issued, your transaction with us may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices, including because of exchange rates. Plexuss does not support all payment methods, currencies or locations for payment. If the payment method you use with us, such as a credit card, reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your payment method information or cancel your account or such Premium Service, you authorize us to continue billing that payment method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. Your obligation to pay fees continues through the end of the subscription period during which you cancel your subscription. All applicable taxes are calculated based on the billing information you provide us at the time of purchase. We do not guarantee refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction. You also acknowledge that Plexuss&rsquo;s Premium Services are subject to this Agreement and any additional terms related to the provision of the Premium Service.</p>

<p><strong>2.8 Notifications and Service Messages</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For purposes of service messages and notices about the Services, Plexuss may place a banner notice across its pages to alert you to certain changes such as modifications to this Agreement. Alternatively, notice may consist of an email from Plexuss to an email address associated with your account, even if we have other contact information. You also agree that Plexuss may communicate with you through your Plexuss account or through other means including email, mobile number, telephone, or delivery services including the postal service about your Plexuss account or services associated with Plexuss.

<p><strong>2.9 Plexuss Applications</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Plexuss may offer the Services through applications built using Plexuss&rsquo;s platform (&ldquo;Plexuss Applications&rdquo;). Plexuss Applications are distinct from third party Platform Applications addressed in Section 4.2. If you use a Plexuss Application or interact with a website that has deployed a plugin, you agree that information about you and your use of the Services, including, but not limited to, your device, your mobile carrier, your internet access provider, your physical location, or web pages containing Plexuss plugins that load in your browser may be communicated to us. Further, by importing any of your Plexuss data through the Plexuss Application, you represent that you have authority to share the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your Plexuss account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing Plexuss through your mobile access provider. Therefore, you should check with your provider to find out if the Services are available and the terms for these services for your specific mobile devices. Finally, by using any downloadable application to enable your use of the Services, you are explicitly confirming your acceptance of the terms of the End User License Agreement associated with the application provided at download or installation, or as may be updated from time to time.</p>

</ol>
<p>The following terms and conditions pertain to text messaging services (the &ldquo;Messaging Services&rdquo;) which are sponsored by or offered by&nbsp;Plexuss, Inc. on its platform and which involve sending one or more text messages to your phone.</p>
<p>By submitting your phone number in a Plexuss, Inc. web form and thereby opting-in to the Plexuss Messaging Services, you explicitly consent to receive one or more texts at the phone number you entered in the form. Some of these texts may market services to you.</p>

<p>We will not be liable for any delays in the receipt of any text messages, as delivery is subject to effective transmission from your mobile service operator. PLEXUSS&rsquo; MESSAGING SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS, AND PLEXUSS MAKES NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.</p>

However, your carriers&rsquo; message &amp; data rates may apply.</p>
<p>To opt-in to Plexuss&rsquo; Messaging Services, enter your mobile number in the web form on the Plexuss website.</p>
<p>To cancel your text subscriptions, text&nbsp;<strong>STOP</strong>&nbsp;in reply to a text message you receive. You may receive one subsequent message confirming your opt-out request.</p>

<p>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither Plexuss nor any of our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, suppliers, employees, shareholders, or directors (&ldquo;Plexuss Affiliates&rdquo;) shall be cumulatively liable for (a) any damages in excess of five times the most recent monthly fee that you paid for a Premium Service, if any, or US $100, whichever amount is greater, or (b) any special, incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use of the Services, any Platform Applications or any of the content or other materials on, accessed through or downloaded from Plexuss.

<ul>
<li>Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and</li>

<p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (&ldquo;ADR&rdquo;) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<li><strong>11. Shopping on Plexuss</strong></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product on and subject to the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of the order price. Dispatch times may vary according to availability and subject to any delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not be responsible.</p>
<p>In order to contract with Plexuss you must be over 18 years of age and possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us. Plexuss retains the right to refuse any request made by you. If your order is accepted we will inform you by email and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted with. This will usually be Plexuss or may in some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party Plexuss is not acting as either agent or principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true and accurate, that you are an authorized user of the credit or debit card used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>a. Our Contract</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be an acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation by e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch will be included in the contract formed.</p>
<ul>
<li>b. Pricing and Availability</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. In all other cases, all sales are final, no returns or refunds are or will be available.</p>
<p>Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are clearly displayed where applicable and included in the 'Total Cost'.</p>
<ul>
<li>c. Payment</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard authorization check on your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to fulfil the transaction. Your card will be debited upon authorisation being received. The monies received upon the debiting of your card shall be treated as a deposit against the value of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the goods have been despatched and you have been sent a confirmation email the monies paid as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the value of goods you have purchased as listed in the confirmation email.</p>
