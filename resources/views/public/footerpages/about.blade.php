		<p>When we buy a car, house, electronics or any other product, there are hundreds of websites that provide feedback and tools of comparison. Education is the biggest investment an individual makes; yet there is not one destination site that can help students and parents choose a college with the best return on investment. With over 4,000 universities, this process can be very complex and stressful.  A college degree is a staple of our identity and there is no return policy. College graduates developed Plexuss to empower students to find and choose the very best college for them.</p>

Once a student completes his or her profile, we will promote and showcase the student to colleges with the best academic reputation. Students will have full control to manage the colleges they want to engage with. We encourage students and parents to be open to the many possibilities, for the best college with the best ROI (return on investment) may be in the same county or it could be across the nation. Very often out of state colleges will provide ample scholarships and grants. As a result students can receive a better education at a lower cost.</p>

		<p>For years colleges have been sending expensive pamphlets & brochures to students with little impact on a prospective student’s decision.  By utilizing Plexuss, colleges now have an opportunity to engage interested students throughout their high school education.  A college on the East Coast now has access to students across the country and internationally.  Colleges will have an opportunity to provide information that will impact a student’s decision.  For example, a student in New York may have never known or considered colleges in Texas, and students in Florida may not know the program for them is in California.  Plexuss uncovers opportunities for both students and colleges.</p>

		<p>Plexus is defined as any complex structure containing an intricate network of parts. We are creating that intricate network amongst students and colleges.  Mainly used to define the complex network of vessels attached to the heart, given the vital role of education we found the name Plexuss fitting for our website.  The added S to Plexus is there to symbolize success. </p>
