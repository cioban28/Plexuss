        <div class="about-blocks tos-block">
          <h2>Your Privacy Matters</h2>
          <p>At Plexuss, our fundamental philosophy is “users first.” This philosophy powers all of the decisions we make, including how we gather and protect your personal information.</p>
          <p>We’ve crafted the policy below to be as clear and straightforward as possible. Our aim is for you—our users—to always feel informed and empowered with respect to your privacy on Plexuss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-blocks tos-block">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Plexuss' mission is to empower students to find and choose the very best college. Our registered users share their information with colleges, engage with colleges they're interested in, and post and view content related to their college-search process. Content on some of our services is also visible to unregistered viewers. We believe that our services allow our users to efficiently select the best based on their search criteria.</p>
          <p>Maintaining your trust is our top priority, so we adhere to the following principles to protect your privacy:</p>
          <p>We protect your personal information and will only provide it to third parties: (1) with your consent; (2) where it is necessary to carry out your instructions; (3) as reasonably necessary in order to provide our features and functionality to you; (4) when we reasonably believe it is required by law, subpoena or other legal process; or (5) as necessary to enforce our User Agreement & Terms of Service or protect the rights, property, or safety of Plexuss, its users and visitors, and the public.</p>
          <p>We have implemented appropriate security safeguards designed to protect your information in accordance with industry standards.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to Plexuss.com and other Plexuss websites, apps, developer platforms and other products and services(collectively, the “ Services ”). We may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time, and if we make material changes to it, we will provide notice through our website or by other means so that you may review the changes before you continue to use Plexuss. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Continuing to use Plexuss after we publish or communicate a notice about any changes to this Privacy Policy means that you are consenting to the changes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-blocks tos-block">
          <h2>1.  What Information We Collect</h2>
          <h3>1.1  Data Controllers</h3>
          <p>The personal information provided to or gathered is controlled by Plexuss, 231 Market Place #241, San ramon, CA 94583. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on Plexuss services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy, you should not become a user of Plexuss, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services. If you have already registered, you can close your account. We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
          <h3>1.2  Registration</h3>
          <p>To create an account on Plexuss, you must provide us with at least your name, email address, and a password. You can choose to provide further information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your mobile number, your gender and/or your high school). We use this information to provide you with more customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content, and this information may also appear on your profile viewable by colleges. You acknowledge that, by creating an account, Plexuss and colleges will be able to identify you by your profile, and you allow Plexuss to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>1.3  Profile Information</h3>
          <p>After you create an account, you may choose to provide additional information on your Plexuss profile, such as test scores, certifications, career goals, and personal interests. With your approval, colleges may choose to communicate with you based on the information you have provided. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from Plexuss. Helping you provide a more complete profile allows prospective colleges to get to know you better. It also enables us to provide you with other relevant content such as scholarship information on and off our site.</p>
          <h3>1.4 Other Services That Sync With Plexuss</h3>
          <p>Plexuss makes other tools available to sync information with Plexuss, and may also develop additional features that allow users to use their Plexuss account in conjunction with other third-party services. Any information that you upload or sync with Plexuss is covered by the User Agreement & Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features Plexuss makes available.</p>
          <h3>1.5  Customer Support</h3>
          <p>When you contact our customer support services (support@plexuss.com), we collect information that helps us categorize your question, respond to it, and, if applicable, investigate any breach of our Privacy Policy. We also use this information to track potential problems and trends and customize our support responses to better serve you.</p>
          <h3>1.6  Using the Plexuss Sites and Applications</h3>
          <p>We collect information when you use (whether as a user or a visitor) the Services. For example, we collect information when you import your transcript, participate in polls, install a Plexuss mobile application, and share articles on Plexuss. If you are logged in on Plexuss or another Service and a Plexuss cookie on your device identifies you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.9 of this policy(e.g., your IP address) will be associated with your account. Even if you’re not logged into a Service, we log information about devices used to access our Services, including IP addresses.</p>
          <h3>1.7  Using Third-Party Services and Visiting Third-Party Sites</h3>
          <p>We receive information when you use your Plexuss account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds Plexuss plugins, we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a user when you visit sites with Plexuss plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. Plexuss will use this information to personalize the Plexuss-provided functionality on third-party sites. Plexuss may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting Plexuss plugins and similar technologies to help them measure Plexuss-generated traffic to their websites.</p>
          <h3>1.8 Cookies</h3>
          <p>We use cookies and similar technologies, including mobile application identifiers, to help us recognize you across different Services, improve your Plexuss experience, increase security, measure use and assess effectiveness of our Services. You can control cookies through your browser settings and other tools. By visiting Plexuss, you consent to the placement of cookies and beacons in your browser and HTML-based emails in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>1.9  Log Files, IP Addresses, and Information About Your Computer and Mobile Device</h3>
          <p>When you visit or leave Plexuss sites or apps (whether as a user or visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a plugin on a third-party site, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing Plexuss using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information on our mobile applications. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to Plexuss, and of course Plexuss will honor your settings.</p>
          <h3>1.10  Other</h3>
          <p>Plexuss is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer our users. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (e.g., limited types of financial information). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-blocks tos-block">
          <h2>2. How we use your personal information</h2>
          <h3>2.1  Consent to Plexuss Processing Information About You</h3>
          <p>The personal information you provide to us may reveal or allow others to identify aspects of your life that are not expressly stated on your profile (for example, your picture or your name may reveal your gender). By providing personal information to us when you create or update your account and profile, you are freely accepting and agreeing to our processing of your personal information in ways set out by this Privacy Policy. Supplying to us any information deemed “sensitive” by applicable law is entirely voluntary on your part. You have the right to withdraw or modify your consent to Plexuss' collection and processing of the information you provide at any time, in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy, by changing your account settings or your profile on Plexuss, or by closing your respective account here.</p>
          <h3>2.2  Plexuss Communications</h3>
          <p>We communicate with you through email, notices posted on the Plexuss websites or apps, text messages, messages to your Plexuss inbox, and other means available through the Services, including mobile text messages and push notifications. These messages will be sent to you based on your profile information and messaging preferences.</p>
          <h3>2.3  User Communications</h3>
          <p>Many communications that you initiate through Plexuss (for example, allowing a college to recruit you) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide other information you put in your profile.</p>
          <h3>2.4  Customized Content</h3>
          <p>We use information that you provide to us to customize your experience and the experiences of others on Plexuss. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display colleges in your state of residence or colleges which offer programs that align with your educational goals.</p>
          <h3>2.5  Sharing Information with Affiliates</h3>
          <p>We may share your personal information with our Plexuss affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with Plexuss) outside of the Plexuss entity that is your data controller as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing.</p>
          <h3>2.6  Sharing Information with Third Parties</h3>
          <p>We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Plexuss services without your consent unless Plexuss has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of Plexuss, our users, visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about Plexuss’ compliance with legal requests for information.</p>
          <p>Content distributed through Plexuss’ sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of Plexuss. If you have bound your Plexuss account to your Twitter account or your Facebook account, you can easily share content from Plexuss to Twitter or Facebook, in accordance with your applicable account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective Twitter or Facebook policies.</p>
          <h3>2.7  Third Parties Using Plexuss Platform Services</h3>
          <p>We collaborate with and allow third parties to use Plexuss' developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with Plexuss. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use Plexuss platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (“Platform Applications”). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to Plexuss. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer.</p>
          <h3>2.8  Polls and Surveys</h3>
          <p>Polls and Surveys may be conducted by Plexuss, users, or third parties. Plexuss or third parties may follow up with you via e-mail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving e-mail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.</p>
          <h3>2.9  Search</h3>
          <p>You can search for colleges, scholarship opportunities, information about colleges, and news articles on Plexuss. We use personal information from Plexuss, including user profiles, to inform and refine our search service.</p>
          <h3>2.10  Posting Information</h3>
          <p>If you post comments, share content, or import a blog or other content, you should be aware that any information you choose to disclose using these services can be read, collected, and used by other users on Plexuss, developers, and other third parties. Plexuss is not responsible for the information you choose to submit. Some content in comment sections may be public and searchable on the Internet.</p>
          <h3>2.11  Testimonials Provided</h3>
          <p>If you provide any testimonials about our goods or services, we may post those testimonials in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials may include your name and other personal information that you have provided.</p>
          <h3>2.12  Premium Services</h3>
          <p>We offer customized user-search functionality as part of colleges’ recruiting process. These services allow colleges to export limited information from users' public profiles, in order to effectively recruit prospective students. A college may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a college application, in connection with Plexuss’ platform. Any personal information obtained independently of Plexuss services will not be added by Plexuss to your profile and is not under Plexuss’ control but is subject to the policies of Plexuss.</p>
          <h3>2.13  Pages for Colleges</h3>
          <p>Plexuss allows colleges to create pages and news articles dedicated to their brand and mission. These pages are public, and any communications or information shared through them will be accessible by the entity that created them.</p>
          <h3>2.14  Compliance with Legal Process and Other Disclosures</h3>
          <p>It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a user or visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if Plexuss has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement & Terms of Service, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of Plexuss, our users, personnel, or others. We attempt to notify users about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but we do not commit to challenge every demand.</p>
          <h3>2.15  Disclosures to Others as the Result of a Change in Control or Sale of Plexuss, Inc.</h3>
          <p>We may also disclose your personal information to a third party as part of a sale of the assets of Plexuss, Inc., a subsidiary, or division, or as the result of a change in control of the company or one of its affiliates, or in preparation for any of these events. Any third party to which Plexuss transfers or sells Plexuss’ assets will have the right to continue to use the personal data and other information that you provide to us in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>2.16  Service Providers</h3>
          <p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services (e.g. maintenance, analysis, audit, marketing and development). These third parties have limited access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated to Plexuss not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>

In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other colleges may have copied or exported out of Plexuss, because this information may not be in our control.</p>
          <h3>3.2  Your rights as an individual based in the EU</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Access to your information: You have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</p></li>
            <li><p>Correcting your information: We want to have accurate data. Please contact us if you think the data we hold is not up to date or correct.</p></li>
            <li><p>Deletion of your information: You have the right to ask us to delete personal data about you if it no longer is required for the purpose it was collected, you have withdrawn your consent, or you have a valid objection to us using your personal data.</p></li>

            <li><p>Restricting how we may use your information: In some cases, you may ask us to restrict how we use your personal data. This right might apply, for example, where we are checking the accuracy of personal data about you that we hold or assessing the validity of any objection you have made to our use of your information. The right might also apply where this is no longer a basis for using your personal data but you don't want us to delete the data.</p></li>
            <li><p>Automated processing: If we use your personal data on an automated basis to make decisions which significantly affect you, you have the right to ask that the decision be reviewed by an individual to whom you may make representations and contest the decision. This right only applies where we use your information with your consent or as part of a contractual relationship with you</p></li>
            <li><p>Withdrawing consent using your information: Where we use your personal data with your consent you may withdraw that consent at any time and we will stop using your personal data for the purpose(s) for which consent was given.</p></li>

          <h3>3.3  Data Retention</h3>
          <p>We retain the personal information you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you services.

We may retain personal information, for a limited period of time, if requested by law enforcement. Plexuss’ Customer Service may retain information for as long as is necessary to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only, but we generally delete or de-personalize closed account data consistent with Section 3.1.</p>
          <h3>3.4  Your Obligations</h3>
          <p>As a user, you have certain obligations to other users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p> You must, at all times, abide by the terms and conditions of the current Privacy Policy, User Agreement & Terms of Service, and other policies of Plexuss. This includes respecting all intellectual property rights that may belong to third parties, such as trademarks or copyrights.</p></li>
            <li><p>You must not upload or otherwise disseminate any information that may infringe on the rights of others or which may be deemed to be injurious, violent, offensive, racist, or xenophobic, or which may otherwise violate the purpose and spirit of Plexuss and its community of Members.</p></li>

          <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
          <p>Our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the type of information and the specific context in which we collect it.</p>
          <p>We process information about you in order to provide our services in accordance with our User Agreement & Terms of Service, for example to allow you to display your profile to other members and colleges, and to allow us to send you important service updates.</p>
          <p>We also process information about you where it is in our legitimate interests to do so and not overridden by your rights (for example, in some cases for direct marketing, fraud prevention, network and information systems security, responding to your communications, and improving our Services).</p>
          <p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect information about you, or may otherwise need the information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.</p>
          <p>We may also process information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-blocks tos-block">
          <h2>5. Personal Information</h2>
          <h3>5.1 Minimum Age</h3>
          <p>As described in the User Agreement & Terms of Service, persons must be 13 years or older to use Plexuss. EU residents: Depending on your country’s applicable laws, we may require parental consent to use Plexuss if you are between 13 and 16.</p>
          <h3>5.2 Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
          <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, or to the Privacy Policy, we will provide notice to you through our Services or by some other means, such as email. Please review the changes carefully. If you agree to the changes, simply continue to use our Services. If you object to any of the changes to our terms and you no longer wish to use Plexuss, you may close your account(s). Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that Plexuss has about you and your account. Using Plexuss after a notice of changes has been communicated to you or published through our Services shall constitute consent to the changed terms or practices.</p>
          <h3>5.3 Transfer Of Information To The US and Other Countries</h3>
          <p>Plexuss is based in the United States. Information about you may be transferred to, and processed in, the US and countries other than the country in which you are resident. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country and, in some cases, may not be as protective. We have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your information will remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <h3>5.4  California's Shine the Light Law</h3>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge. Under Section 1798.83, Plexuss currently does not share any personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
          <h3>5.5 Security</h3>
          <p>We have implemented security safeguards designed to protect the personal information that you provide in accordance with industry standards. Access to your data on Plexuss is password-protected, and sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption when it is exchanged between your web browser and the Plexuss Services. We also offer secure https access to the Plexuss.com website. All data we collect is stored on our servers located in the United States at a data center in Oregon hosted by Amazon Web Services, Inc. (Amazon). Your personal information will be routed through, and stored on, those servers as part of the service. Amazon has certified that it adheres to relevant US and European Union data privacy regulations. If the location of our servers changes in the future, we will update this Policy. To protect any data you store on our servers, we also regularly monitor our system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks. In addition, we have instituted authentication and access controls designed to protect all data in our systems. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to Plexuss. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that emails, messaging, and similar means of communication with other users and colleges are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password. You should review our policy regularly to keep informed of any updates.</p>
