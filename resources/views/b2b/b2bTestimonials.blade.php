              <p>As the International Student Coordinator for Atlanta Technical College I wish to share my experience since my initial membership in 2015. The Plexuss site has been valuable to the recruiting efforts for international students since the very beginning and is a main resource for reaching international as well as domestic students for the college.</p>
              <p>With recent political events the approach to recruiting international students require strategic creativity that the Plexuss team continuously offer. I have been able to witness the constant efforts to make the site more user friendly for both the student and recruiter. The Plexuss team have been innovative in their approach to meet the specific needs of the customer and offer a tailored plan for each unique request. Although the site is currently a great tool for increasing the international student body, I don't think they ever stop looking for ways to improve the service even more. There seems to be a continuous collaboration to fine tune the services for the customer as they remain on the cutting edge.</p>
              <p>The yield since using Plexuss increased international enrollment at Atlanta Tech approximately by 15% just in the first year. The site will help you track your progress and determine what features are most useful for your specific needs. The way the site is designed makes it easy to measure enrollment trends, filter the type students that fit the college program offerings and provides timely data so that it is possible to make strategic decisions to advance enrollment. Although globally sophisticated the Plexuss team remain personable and always accessible to meet your requests, concerns or inquiries.</p>

              <p>Northern State University started collaborating with Plexuss almost three years ago. It became a successful partnership right away, one that allowed us to enroll a few highly qualified international students. Plexuss staff have always provided excellent customer service and are extremely receptive to our needs and recommendations. The company is growing fast and we are proud to both assist with and benefit from their innovative approach to student recruitment.</p>

              <p>We have worked with Plexuss.com for over 2 years now, starting with the free chats and general outreach, to stepping up our partnership by becoming a premium member this past year and participating in additional services including targeted campaigns, texting conversations, webinars, prescreened prospective students, student interviews and more. The Plexuss team are constantly striving to assess and meet the needs of the student and the institutions they work with more effectively. As I handle international recruitment, admissions, immigration specialist, academic adviser and a good deal of programming, being able to work with the Plexuss crew has made recruitment easier and more effective. Applications are up and in the next year we expect a 25-30% increase in our international population.</p>

            <p>Liberty University is pleased to partner with Plexuss to build both domestic and international student enrollment. From the day JP Novin personally visited our campus to demonstrate the Plexuss platform, I was impressed with the company’s founder, its streamlined technology, and its global reach. However, since becoming a client, I am even more impressed with the personal professional service the staff provide. I feel like we have added team members who are as committed to finding ‘best-fit’ students for our university as my full-time employees. But it gets even better! Since the time we were first introduced to Plexuss, the company has improved its technology to provide even better services. I have been in international enrollment management for nearly 30 years, and this is the first company that is actually delivering the ‘goods’ they promised on Day 1. I look for a long and fruitful relationship with Plexuss.</p>
